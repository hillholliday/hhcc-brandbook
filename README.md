## Installation
1. Install this repo as a submodule in the root of your directory `git submodule add https://github.com/hillholliday/hhcc-brandbook.git`
2. Symlink all the files from this submodule into your `scss` directory. `ln -s hhcc-brandbook/* build/scss/`
3. Any changes you make will need to come *after* where you've included these styles, or else they will get overwritten next time you git pull this directory.
